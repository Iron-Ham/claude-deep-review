### Scale Assessor Agent

**Task tool parameters:**
- `subagent_type`: `Explore`
- `description`: "Assess scalability"

**Prompt:**
```
Identify scalability risks - things that become problems as the codebase grows.

{SCOPE_CONTEXT}

## Analysis Focus

1. **Ease of adding new modules**:
   - How many files need to be touched to add a new feature module?
   - Is there boilerplate that must be copied?
   - Are there registration steps that are easy to forget?

2. **Manual steps in multiple places**:
   - Configuration that must be updated in several files
   - Lists that must be kept in sync
   - Build configuration that grows with modules

3. **Module boundary clarity**:
   - Can a new developer understand where to put new code?
   - Are module responsibilities clear?
   - Is there guidance for module organization?

4. **Modules growing too large**:
   - Modules that keep accumulating code
   - "Misc" or "Utils" modules that are dumping grounds
   - Feature modules that have become monoliths

5. **Large files becoming maintenance burdens**:
   - Files that are hard to navigate
   - Files with too many responsibilities
   - Files that multiple people frequently conflict on
